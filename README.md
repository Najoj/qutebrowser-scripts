# qutebrowser-scripts
I have been experimenting with [qutebrowser](https://github.com/The-Compiler/qutebrowser/) and writing user-scripts for it. Might be useful for others.

* `cookie-cleaner.sh` - deletes all non-whitelisted cookies
* `delete_old_history.sh` - deletes old entries from history and hint completion history
* `rm-cookie.sh` - remove cookies for current host
* `user-agent-switch.sh` - switches user agent 
* `whitelist.sh` - whitelist pages to keep their cookies
