# qutebrowser-scripts
I have been experimenting with [qutebrowser](https://github.com/The-Compiler/qutebrowser/) and writing user-scripts for it. Might be useful for others.

* `delete_old_history.sh` - deletes old entries from history and hint completion history
* `user-agent-switch.sh` - switches user agent 
* `whitelist.sh` - whitelist pages to keep their cookies, with [qutebrowser-cookiecleaner](https://gitlab.com/zerodogg/qutebrowser-cookiecleaner)
